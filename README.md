# Description
## Project structure
This project is separated in two repositories, one for the backend and other for the frontend. To navigate between the two repositories use these links:
- Frontend:[not yet]()
- Backend: [https://github.com/Jofay-zs/ztrore](https://github.com/Jofay-zs/ztrore)

## What was the goal of the project ? üòÄ
Develop a DApp (Desentralized Application) that I enjoy creating, at the same time that I learn a lot of stuff relationated with web3, NFTs and crypto.

## What does the project do ? üè™
ztrore is a NFT marketplace compatible with the EIP 721 standar of Ethereum. Where each NFT is created from your wallet address and these can be purchased for free.

## How and what was it build with ? ü•£
It was created with technologies and tools like: Solidity, Open Zeppelin, Hardhat, React, JS, Tailwind, a lot of documetation and videos. To see more about the tools and technologies [scroll down üîΩ](#tools-and-technologies-used).

The path I followed was first backend and smart contracts and then frontend. To see more about my path [scroll down üîΩ](#my-path)

## Technical difficulties ‚öóÔ∏è
The biggest problems I found was in smart contracts, due to my little knowledge on them. And in the beginning a mental block.

## Improvements for the future üîÆ
I thought of two options for the future of this project.
1. Use other APIs to generate different NFTs, some examples of APIs that I found was, a kitten API generator, a Robot API generator and a Monster API generator.
2. Which personally I consider more difficult, but exciting, is re-create the entire app with assets created by me, and adding more metadata, to create more unique and different NFTs. Explore smart contracts more and use more features of the technologies that I used.

# Tools and technologies used
- ## [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)
    Hardhat is a development environment that allows us to compile, test and deploy smart contracts.

    Tips:
    - To run a script use: ```npx hardhat run scripts/scriptName```
    - To compile use: ```npx hardhat compile```
    - To test use: ```npx hardhat test```
    - To deploy use: ```npx hardhat run scripts/scriptName.js```

- ## [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
    Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

    Solidity compiles on the EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)

- ## [Open Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin/)
    Since the smart contracts are standardized and do found management, the biggest concern is security. For this exist organizations like Open Zeppelin, which provide standar smart contracts, open source and previously audited. I used smart contracts and functions from Open Zeppelin like:
    - [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721)
        Standard for NFTs, links to know more:
        - [link01](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
        - [link02](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721)
    - [ERC721 Enumrable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721Enumerable)
    - [Counters](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#Counters)

- ## JS

- ## [Avatars Generator](https://getavataaars.com/)

# My path
The first thing I do was reinforce my knowledge in blockchain, NFTs, Solidity, Ethereum and Web3. Once I felt good, I start developing the smart-contracts and backend. Finally whit the hard part done, I start developing the front-end

# My learning
## Deploy
Your script and contract is not deployed to a central server, it is added to the blockchain through a transaction.

## EIP and ERC
An EIP or Ethereum Improvement Proposals are formal documents which contains improvement proposals for the Ethereum protocol. And ERC or Ethereum Request for Comments are preliminary proposals for the EIP.
