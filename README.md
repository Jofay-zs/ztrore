## Tools & technologies used

### [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)
Hardhat is a development environment that allows us to compile, test and deploy smart contracts.

Tips:
- To run a script use: ```npx hardhat run scripts/scriptName```
- To compile use: ```npx hardhat compile```
- To test use: ```npx hardhat test```
- To deploy use: ```npx hardhat run scripts/scriptName.js```

### [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity compiles on the EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)

## My learning
### Deploy
Your script and contract is not deployed to a central server, it is added to the blockchain through a transaction.
